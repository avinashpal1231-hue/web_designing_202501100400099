    <p><b>Varanasi</b>, also known as Benares or Kashi, is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world and holds immense religious significance in India. Located on the banks of the sacred Ganges River in the state of Uttar Pradesh, Varanasi is considered a major spiritual hub for Hindus, Buddhists, and Jains.</p>
    <p>Varanasi is renowned for its ghats, which are a series of steps leading down to the river. These ghats are used for various religious rituals, including bathing in the holy waters of the Ganges, performing cremation ceremonies, and conducting prayer ceremonies known as "aarti." The ghats are particularly vibrant during festivals and special occasions when devotees gather to celebrate and seek blessings.</p>
